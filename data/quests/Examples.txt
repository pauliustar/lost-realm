state Return

Explanation:

When the player talks to the Sheep Hunter (quest ID 1 required) then
the hunter will ask the player to kill 20 sheeps, if he accepts it
he'll get to the next state and will have to kill 20 sheeps to get rewarded.

By using: "If", "Elseif" and "Else" you can decide the action by checking a rule.
Then the last thing that'll be called is action End() to make sure the quest won't be repeatable.

Quests should be saved as 00001.eqf etc.
